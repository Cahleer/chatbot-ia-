is used in translation or accompanied by expressions such as “kind”, “type”, “style”, “imitati on” or the like (Article 23). Some exceptions (for homonymous GIs for example) and additional obligations apply (Article 24). In particular, the genericity exception applies to those GIs that are identical to the customary name of a grap e variety (such as Montepulciano). And there are is a second ‘grand-fathering clause’ which a llows the continuous use of a protected GI for wines or spirits by thos e who can prove a prior use (before 1984, or in good faith before 1994). Finally, WTO Members may not refuse, if re quested, to conduct negotiations of international agreements aimed at increasing the protection of individual GIs for wines and spirits. Policy debate at the WTO: ‘usurpation’ versus ‘confiscation’ At the World Trade Organization, a few countries expressed their willingness to renegotiate the Section relative to GIs of the TRIPS Agreement under the Doha Round; eventually the subject was not retained. 17 There is however a so-called ‘built-in agenda’ of negotiations aimed at establishi ng a multilateral system of noti fication and registration of GIs for wines, ‘built-in’ in the sense that negotiations of this register were mandated in Article 23.4 of the TRIPS Agreement. Since no deadlines were set and since negotiations have systematically failed to conclude, they are now part of the Doha Round of multilateral negotiations. The Doha mandate on GIs includes two issues: the creation of the multilateral register for wines and spirits ; and the extension of the higher level of protection granted under Article 23 beyond wines and spirits. 18 17 The current situation regarding negotiations is de tailed in the WTO website, TRIPS: Geographical Indications, Background and the current situation, version of February 2010: http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trip s_e/gi_background_e.htm#wines_spirits Refer also to WTO documents TN/IP/W/7, TN/IP/W/8, TN/IP/W/12, WT/GC/W/546, TN/C/W/25, TN/C/W/50 and revisions thereby. 18 The built-in agenda of Article 23.4 refers only to wines. Th e extension of the mandate to include spirits was highly resented at the beginning as it affected the balance of benefits struck during the Uruguay Round; it is less controversial these days since the Doha Round presents oppo rtunities for trade-offs in other areas under negotiation. I am grateful to Sergio Escudero for pointing out this aspect. 39 Succinctly, current discussions at the WTO oppose two groups of countries. On one side, the friends of GIs favor a strong level of protection (no misleading requirement and no generic exemption), the establishmen t of a global registry of GIs and the extension of the special protection for wines and spirits to all prod ucts. Their main point is to argue against the ‘usurpation’ of their geographical indications by New World producers. 19 The EU has the strongest position, defined in a proposal dated June 2005 (TN/IP/W/11). The EU calls for the TRIPS Agreement to be amended by adding an annex to Article 23.4 requesting that the registration of a GI would establish a ‘rebut table presumption’ that the term is
