presentation of the research process and results. Additionally, the authors of journal articles are more diverse, including university faculty and students, as well as participants in social practice activities, collectively promoting academic research and social development [ 35]. Dissertations, on the other hand, are authored by graduate students under the guidance of mentors, allowing for comprehensive research on specific fields or issues without strict length limitations, thereby enabling full presentation of the research process and results. Dif- ferences between journal articles and dissertations may influence the relationship between GI products and farmer incomes [36]. Differences in journal quality: journals with higher impact factors may prioritize innovative research findings and significant statistical results. Preferences for different types of research on the relationship between GI products and farmer incomes may stem from the specific reader base and academic positioning of each journal [ 37]. Some journals Agriculture 2024 ,14, 798 6 of 17 may focus more on theoretical exploration and model construction, while others may prefer empirical research and case studies. These differences not only reflect the academic tendencies of the journals but also demonstrate the continuous deepening of academic understanding of this complex relationship [ 38]. Therefore, differences in journal quality may influence the relationship between GI products and farmer incomes. Differences in publication years: over different years, due to various factors such as research foundations and policy environments, scholars’ studies on the relationship between GI products and farmer incomes may focus on different aspects, leading to diverse research outcomes [ 39]. Additionally, academic research tends to accumulate and deepen over time, with new research questions and directions emerging, while older studies may gradually fade. Newer papers may build on previous research, possessing richer knowledge backgrounds to enhance research accuracy and reliability. In contrast, earlier papers may use more traditional or basic research methods [ 40]. Furthermore, papers published in different years may use different data sources and analysis methods. As technology advances and data availability increases, newer papers may use more extensive and detailed datasets and employ more advanced data analysis methods, leading to differences in conclusions and deeper insights [41]. 2.2.3. Sources of Differences in Methodological Approaches On the one hand, there are different research methods: existing literature involves two main categories of research methods, namely, multiple linear regression analysis and other methods. Different research methods have certain differences in assumptions and applica- bility, which may lead to diversity in research results [ 42]. For instance, Stanley (2021) used multiple linear regression analysis to analyze the economic benefits of GI products, finding that unique GI products often have unique flavors, quality, or production processes, giving them a competitive advantage in the market and attracting consumers willing to pay higher prices, thereby contributing to increased farmer incomes [ 43]. Conversely, Chaney (2008) found through the use of a random forest model and panel data analysis that although some GI products have excellent quality, consumer demand for them is limited. This limits the expansion of these products’ market share, making it
