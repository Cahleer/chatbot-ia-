Rural Rwandan tea producers lack high -tech information. Urban -rural balance is large. ICTs have increasingly been linked to cutting -edge services for data management and number crunching, GIS app lications, knowledge -based systems, robots, and better agricultural machinery and processes, as the sector has to innovate and the government promotes off -farm jobs. Linking diverse innovation communities —local, subsectoral, or national —has been neglected. ICTs as "collectors," "analyzers," "sharers," and "disseminators" improve agriculture interventions in poor nations. Affordable smartphone apps help farmers capitalise on marketplaces, adjust to unfavourable agricultural conditions, and communicate with p ublic service agents. Agriculture needs innovation systems. Innovation improves global productivity, competitiveness, and economic growth. Creativity boosts society, wealth, and poverty. Networks, associations, extension services, ICT, and other enablers a nd bridges can coordinate innovation. ICTs allow researchers, disseminators, users, and network partners to engage and share knowledge. This study employs applicable ideas to identify the main difficulties affecting Rwanda's agricultural tea sector. We eva luated a structural model to identify key factors impacting tea cultivation efficiency and their relationship to promote sustainability. Rwanda's western province's 20 –50-year -old farmers, wholesalers, distributors, and exporters take a regular survey. Cov ariance -based structural equation modelling We study tea farmers' creativity. IT market orientation improves agricultural innovation. 2) ICT and agriculture funding impact innovation. ICT -enhanced agricultural extension boosts innovation to a lesser level. The research links ICT to market orientation, agriculture finance, and innovation. They believe ICT enhanced agricultural innovation. The research proposes Rwandan agricultural tea cultivation business countermeasures based on industrialised nation tea ad vancements and Rwandan conditions.

NAAR, April 2023 , Volume 6, Issue 4, 105 -118 106 of 118 Introduction and background In China, tea has been grown and consumed for more than 2,000 years. It is currently the caffeine -containing beverage that is drunk the most globally. Only water is consumed more widely worldwide [1]. Rwanda traditionally produces tea, which is a significant revenue crop. Since being
