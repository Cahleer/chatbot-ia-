In both countries registrations are granted by governments after 45 Agreement between the European Union and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on cooperation on, and protection of, geographical indications, OJ (L) 408I of 4.12.2020. The recently entered into force EU-China Agreement (March 1, 2021) recognises 26 important Italian denominations for food– e.g., Prosciutto di Parma, Grana Padano, Parmigiano Reggiano –, but also names of wines – e.g. Chianti, Barolo, Brunello di Montalcino, Prosecco - Conegliano Valdobbiadene. Among overall GIs protected under the agreement (100), Italy is the European country with the highest number of protected names. 46 European Union–South Korea Free T rade Agreement, OJ (L) 127 of 4.05.2011. For a full overview of the agreement, see: B. O’Connor and G.

Therefore, as far as agricultural products are concerned, Japan and the EU are bound by the minimum standard obligations under Articles 22-24 TRIPS. 50 As far as the EU is concerned see the already mentioned Regulation No 1151/2012 and Regulation 2019/787. As far as Japan is concerned, see the 2005 Act on Protection 136E. Bonadio, N. Lucchi, M. Contardi an examination is carried out that aims at checking the quality of the relevant products and the link between such quality and the geographical areas. Specifically, both the EU and Japan already have in place an advanced system of GI registration procedure, which complies with the requirements under Chapter 14 51. Such system consists of steps such as: (1) making available to the public the lists of registered GIs; (2) managing administrative processes aimed at verifying that the name identifi es a product as originating from the geographical area in question, where the quality, reputation or other feature of the good is essentially attributable to its geographical origin; (3) an opposition procedure that allows the legitimate interests of third parties to be taken into consideration; and (4) a cancellation procedure 52. Also, both EU and Japanese laws offer a wide scope of protection, as GI owners are given the right to prevent others from using their signs not only to confuse consumers as to the geographical origin of the product, but also from merely evoking and recalling such names. Chapter 14 confirms such wide scope of protection also for the 217 EU GIs as well as the 56 Japanese GIs included in JEPA 53. Thus, the EU has obtained protection of many European geographical names in Japan (this has happened through a procedure which has included publication and the submission of opinions by interested parties, and which
