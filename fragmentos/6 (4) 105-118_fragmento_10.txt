Discussion This research looked at the impact of ICT on the innovation of tea farmers in Rwanda. The findings of this research reveal that ICT has a beneficial effect on agricultural finance and market orientation, which led to greater agricultural innovation, which may be explained by findings, which show that ICT can lead to agricultural innovation [7], [8] . The findings also show that ICT improves agricultural financing, market orientation, and agricultural extension. The mediator and the independent variable constructs have a pleasant relationship. That suggests that ICT, as a tool, has a positive impact not only in our daily lives but also on the farm. It positively influences market orientation, agricultural financing, and agricu ltural extension. According to the hypothesis, the independent variables generally influence agricultural innovation positively, but the agricultural extension has a smaller impact on innovation. The agricultural extension does not directly lead to innovation, which is explained by the fact that Rwandan farmers are already grouped in many farming cooperatives, and communication among them is already at a high level. This is not surprising because the art of communication and working together among te a farmers in Rwanda is not new, and NAAR, April 2023 , Volume 6, Issue 4, 105 -118 115 of 118 the local government is always involved in updating farmers' skills, introducing new varieties, and workin g hand in hand with the farmers [19]. To address modern challenges of innovation, they must be market -oriented a nd consider what the final consumer wants and needs. There is also a need to increase financing in agriculture, which is the primary employer in Rwanda, and tea is the primary subsector, so more investment is required. Another unexpected finding is that th e relationship between ICT and independent variables is more fruitful than the relationship between ICT and dependent variables. That is explained by the fact that simply having an Internet connection
