When sample heterogeneity is high, a random-effects model is usually adopted, while a fixed-effects model is more suitable when the samples are relatively homogeneous [ 50]. Through heterogeneity tests conducted on the included effect sizes, we found that both overall and subtype GI products exhibited high heterogeneity. Overall, the heterogeneity test result for the relationship between GI products and farmer incomes was Q = 50,181.92 ( p< 0.05), I2= 99.83, indicating that approx- imately 99.83% of the observed variation in the model comes from true differences in effect sizes, with about 1.17% originating from random error. Therefore, the relationship between the two was confirmed through the heterogeneity test. Similarly, from the perspectives of GI products and per capita disposable income, as well as GI products and agricultural product price increases, the corresponding I2and Q values both indicated a high degree of heterogeneity in their relationships. Hence, subsequent studies will analyze using a random-effects model, and it is necessary to explore the moderating effects of variables on the relationship between GI products and farmer incomes. Table 3 summarizes the meta-analysis results of the correlation coefficients between GI products and farmer incomes. It was found that the development of GI products is significantly positively correlated with farmer incomes (r = 0.348, 95%CI = [0.104, 0.540]). Referring to the standards set by Gignac and Szodorai (2016), this study interprets correla- tion coefficient magnitudes where 0.1 < r < 0.2, 0.2 < r < 0.3, and r > 0.3 are considered low, moderate, and high correlations, respectively [ 51]. According to this standard, this study believes that GI products have a highly positive impact on farmer incomes. Furthermore, we divided farmer incomes into per capita disposable income and agricultural product price increases for further analysis. The relationship between GI products and per capita disposable income was highly positively correlated (r = 0.389, 95%CI = [0.056, 0.644]), while the relationship between GI products and agricultural product price increases showed a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.255, 95%CI = [0.214, 0.296]). Therefore, research hypotheses H1, H1a, and H1b are supported. Table 3. Integrity test.

Moderation Analysis After conducting heterogeneity tests, we found significant heterogeneity character- istics in the relationship between GI products and farmer incomes, indicating that this relationship may be influenced by certain potential moderating variables. To further ex- plore this mechanism of influence, this study coded and analyzed the collected information Agriculture 2024 ,14, 798 11 of 17 and conducted subgroup analyses. Detailed research results are shown in Table 4. At the sample level, country differences, regional scope, and sample type all significantly moderate the relationship between GI products and farmer incomes ( p< 0.05). In the context of China, the
