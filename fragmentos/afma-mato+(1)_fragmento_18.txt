also for the 217 EU GIs as well as the 56 Japanese GIs included in JEPA 53. Thus, the EU has obtained protection of many European geographical names in Japan (this has happened through a procedure which has included publication and the submission of opinions by interested parties, and which was finalised before JEPA entered into force). Champagne, Feta, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Camembert de Normandie, Prosciutto Toscano and Prosecco are just a few examples. Obviously, Japan has also secured protection of some of its own GIs in the of the Names of Specific Agricultural, Forestry and Fishery Products and Foodstuffs as well as the 2015 Notice on Establishing Indication Standards Concerning GI for Liquor.

Extending the protection of geographical indications within and beyond the EU 137EU, ‘Kobe beef’ being the most notable example. Yet, the EU has obtained by far the highest number of protected indications. A quick look at the long list of EU protected names referred to in JEPA’s Annex 14-B, as opposed to the shorter list of the corresponding Japanese indications, is quite telling. As shown above, the EU does have 217 GIs (72 for food and 145 for wines and spirits) while Japan has just 56 (48 for food and 8 for wines and spirits) 54. The lists may also be amended (and possibly expanded) in the future55, leaving the EU and Japan free to decide at a later stage to protect additional GIs 56. 5. Conclusion The EU regularly seeks strong protection for geographical indications for agricultural products and foodstuffs, as well as for wines and spirits, both at home and in countries with which bilateral negotiations are taking place. This pressure for stronger protection, which is certainly much higher than in other countries, comes from powerful lobbies within the agri-food sector, particularly in countries such as France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece. Within the EU, the CJEU has recently extended the scope of protection of geographical indications. However, whether this is necessarily a result consistent with the traditional aims of GI is debatable. In particular, the CJEU rulings in the Queso Manchego and Morbier cases are quite controver- sial and risk making the EU sui generis GI protection system an easy target for criticism. Most aspects of such a system are certainly to be commended, but it seems difficult to justify the extended protection recently approved by the ECJ with such an overbroad notion of “evocation” ( Queso Manchego ) and the unusual protection of
