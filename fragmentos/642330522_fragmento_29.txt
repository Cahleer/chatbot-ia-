This introduction gives some figures regard ing GIs and goes into some length into reviewing the international legal framework for the protection of GIs. The remainder of the paper is divided in two Chapters, each Chapter with its own literature review. Chapter 1 develops an analytic framework th at borrows from club goods theory to model 9 The TRIPS Agreement is part of the single undertak ing negotiated during the U ruguay Round of multilateral negotiations which created the WTO in 1994; as such, it has to date 153 signatories. 33 Figure 0.1: Disparities in value of GIs GI value in billion Euros (€50 billion total ?)

In the classical taxonomy of goods developed by Paul A. Samuelson in 1954, club goods are defined as excludable and non-rival (although congestible) goods, as opposed to private goods (excludable and rival), common goods (non-excludable but rival) and pure public goods (non-excludable, non-rival). The focus of the Chapter is on the within-club organizational challenges and economic interactions given the legal protection of a GI following the TRIPS requirements. The international aspect of th e economics of GIs is developed in Chapter 2, with a focus on the economics of “claw-ba ck”, the procedure by which a foreign GI that had previously acquired generic status in a country starts being recognized and protected in that country. Figures Estimates on GI value added and exports ar e neither comprehensive nor consistent, however some figures from different sources were recently compiled showing great disparities in value (Giovanucci et al. 2009). Roughly, while Fr ance, Italy and Spain account for close to 10% of registered GIs, they account for close to 70% of GIs total value worldwide. The number of protected G Is in the world is put at more than 10,300, 90% of which originate in the 30 OECD count ries, with a “trade value” of close to US$ 50 billion ( €36.7 billion at the current exchange rate, probably meaning exports). This estimate is definitely conservative since the European Commission has evaluated the combined value generated by its three main GI countries, France, Italy and 34 Spain to be €34.5 billion in 2002 (European Commission 2003),10 and GIs in seven other EU countries generated and added value of about €5.2 billion (Giovanucci et al. 2009). In addition, the European Communities represent more than half the total number of protected GIs, with 6,021 r egistered GIs (of which 5,200 for wines and spirits). In spirits alone, of the €5.4 billion of EU exports, €3.5 billion pertain to GI- labeled spirits (Giovanucci et al. 2009). Figure 0.1 shows the disparities in value with an estimated worldwide value of GI pro ducts put (rather arbitrarily) at €50
