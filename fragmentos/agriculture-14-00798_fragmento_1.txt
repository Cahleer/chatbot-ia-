Abstract: Geographical indication (GI) products serve as one of the significant instruments for increasing farmers’ income. While most studies affirmatively indicate that GI products contribute to boosting farmers’ income growth, it is noteworthy that their relationship does not consistently demonstrate a positive correlation. The academic discourse on this issue remains inconclusive. This study employs a meta-analysis method to reanalyze 140 effect sizes from 32 independent research samples across diverse global contexts. The findings reveal that the development of GI products significantly promotes farmer income growth, showing a high positive correlation (r = 0.348, CI = [0.104, 0.540] ). Specifically, there exists a high positive correlation between GI products and per capita disposable income (r = 0.389) and a moderate positive correlation between GI products and agricultural product prices (r = 0.255). Further analysis indicates that factors at the sample level, literature level, and methodological level all exert moderating effects on the relationship between GI products and farmers’ income. This study not only provides a scientific response to the debate surrounding the relationship between GI products and farmers’ income but also delves into the underlying mechanisms. It holds significant importance for advancing the rational optimization of agricultural resources and enhancing agricultural competitiveness.

Question Raised Agricultural production is rooted in natural reproduction and intricately intertwined with economic reproduction, with specific requirements for ecological resources and envi- ronmental conditions. In regions where agriculture dominates as the leading industry, the core to achieving rural revitalization strategies and growth targets for agricultural operating income lies in fully leveraging rich regional natural resource advantages to convert these resource advantages into quality advantages, which then, through the process of economic reproduction, can be transformed into economic advantages [ 1]. Geographical indication (GI) products serve as an effective tool that pivots around quality advantages to convert regional resource advantages into economic advantages. As a symbol of quality and reputa- tion, they facilitate trust-building between consumers and producers and stabilize market size and consumer base, embodying substantial market potential and wealth value. The specific quality and reputation attributes of GI products depend on the natural ecology and humanistic factors of their
