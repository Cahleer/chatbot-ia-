The very first piece of EU GI legislation was introduced in the early 1990s, i.e. Regulation 2081/929. It was negotiated at the time when European Union decision-makers were discussing the reform of the CAP and ultimately provided an important opportunity to further harmonize GI by creating two important titles of protection: protected designations of origin (PDOs) and protected geographical indications (PGIs) 10. The process has not been smooth initially for a variety of reasons, including the fact that some EU Member States had not adopted any scheme of GI protection before 1992 11. Regulation 2081/92 was subsequently replaced by Regulation 510/200612, which in turn was repealed by Regulation 1151/201213. Although the original system has been substantially maintained, the current system has undergone some changes, including the legal basis used to enact the act. While the previous basis was the CAP , the current one is also found in Article 118 of the T reaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which allows the European Parliament and the Council to establish measures to create pan-European 6 Regulation (EU) No. 1308/2013 establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products and repealing Regulations 922/72, 234/79, 1037/2001 and 1234/2007, 2013 OJ (L347). 7 Regulation (EU) 251/2014 on the definition, description, presentation, labelling and the protection of geographical indications of aromatised wine products and repealing Regulation 1601/91, 2014 OJ (L84). 8 Regulation EU 2019/787 on the definition, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks, the use of the names of spirit drinks in the presentation and labelling of other foodstuffs, the protection of geographical indications for spirit drinks, the use of ethyl alcohol and distillates of agricultural origin in alcoholic beverages, and repealing Regulation 110/2008, 2019 OJ (L130). 9 Regulation (EEC) 2081/92 of the Council of July 14, 1992, on the protection of geo- graphical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs, 1992 O.J. (L208). 10 Regulation 2081/92 also created the so-called Certificates of Specificity, now called T raditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG). This title protects the traditional aspects of a product e.g. the manufacturing technique. When a name is registered as TSG, it is pro-tected against falsification and misuse. 11 See A. di Lauro, Le Denominazioni di Origine Protette (DOP) e le Indicazioni Geografiche Protette (IGP) , cit. 12 Commission Regulation (EC) No 510/96 of 22 March 1996 concerning the classifi- cation of certain goods in the combined nomenclature, 1996 OJ (L76/7). 13 Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs, 2012 OJ (L 343). 126E.
