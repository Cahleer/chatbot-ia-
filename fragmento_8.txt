ICT is very crucial to making our farming efficient and profitable Normality Check In this study, the CFA and SEM will be determined using the Maximum Likelihood estimation method. First, we tested if the data nearly follow a normal distribution. In general terms, complete standards of kurtosis in dexes greater than 10 fundamental values of skew indexes larger than 3 indicate a direct violation of normality [24]. In this paper, the skewness indexes scale from −1.824 to 0.234, and the kurtosis indexes range from 1.625 to 5.735. As a result, we can show Table 2 that ther e is no violation of normality.

The value of composite reliability (C.R.) for all factors see Table 4 below was higher than 0.6, so approving the reliability of th e model [25]. Table 4 showed that the factor loadings of all items were larger than 0.5. Also, we checked the values of average variance extracted (AVE) for all constructs which were also higher than 0.5, approving the convergent validity of the model [26]. We evaluated the square root of AVE for each construct of the model (diagonal values) in Table 5 which were higher than inner construct correlations (off -diagonal values), showing discriminant validity for the model Table 4 showed that the measurement model lights the condition for the reliability and validity of the constructs and discriminant validity. Professional thoughts demonstrated satisfactory validity in terms of instrument validity. Cronbach’s Alphas (α) test was used to assess the reliabilit y of the constructed instrument, with a significance level of (α ≥ 0.7) as recommended in [27]. The purpose of the factor analysis test was to ensure that the degree of relevance of each item in the design was correct. First, the measurement model’s prop erties were evaluated by checking the convergent validity, reliability, and discriminant validity. To see if the measurement model matches the sample adequately, several goodness -of-fit indices are used. For the data results, the p -value of the Chi -square was 0.000 (χ 2 = 455.282, df = 182). For a proper model fit, the p -value should be greater than 0.05, as
