Abstract:  IT improves agriculture. Rural Rwandan tea producers lack high -tech information. Urban -rural balance is 
large. ICTs have increasingly been linked to cutting -edge services for data management and number crunching, 
GIS app lications, knowledge -based systems, robots, and better agricultural machinery and processes, as the sector 
has to innovate and the government promotes off -farm jobs. Linking diverse innovation communities —local, 
subsectoral, or national —has been neglected.  ICTs as "collectors," "analyzers," "sharers," and "disseminators" 
improve agriculture interventions in poor nations. Affordable smartphone apps help farmers capitalise on 
marketplaces, adjust to unfavourable agricultural conditions, and communicate with p ublic service agents. 
Agriculture needs innovation systems. Innovation improves global productivity, competitiveness, and economic 
growth. Creativity boosts society, wealth, and poverty. Networks, associations, extension services, ICT, and other 
enablers a nd bridges can coordinate innovation. ICTs allow researchers, disseminators, users, and network partners 
to engage and share knowledge. This study employs applicable ideas to identify the main difficulties affecting 
Rwanda's agricultural tea sector. We eva luated a structural model to identify key factors impacting tea cultivation 
efficiency and their relationship to promote sustainability. Rwanda's western province's 20 –50-year -old farmers, 
wholesalers, distributors, and exporters take a regular survey. Cov ariance -based structural equation modelling We 
study tea farmers' creativity. IT market orientation improves agricultural innovation. 2) ICT and agriculture 
funding impact innovation. ICT -enhanced agricultural extension boosts innovation to a lesser level.  The research 
links ICT to market orientation, agriculture finance, and innovation. They believe ICT enhanced agricultural 
innovation. The research proposes Rwandan agricultural tea cultivation business countermeasures based on 
industrialised nation tea ad vancements and Rwandan conditions.

 Introduction and background  
In China, tea has been grown and consumed for more than 2,000 years. It is currently the caffeine -containing beverage 
that is drunk the most globally. Only water is  consumed more widely worldwide [1]. 
Rwanda traditionally produces tea, which is a significant revenue crop. Since being introduced by missionaries in 
1952, tea has developed into an industry with a specific exportation goal. The cultivation of tea began  on a limited 
scale and is now developing in the Rwandan Northern, Western, and Southern regions. Due to its favorable 
temperature, tropical, volcanic soils, and evenly distributed annual rainfall ranging from 1,200 to 1,400 millimeters, 
Rwanda is naturall y favored for growing tea. Most tea is grown in drained marshes and hilly areas between 1,55 0 m 
and 2,500 m above sea level [2]. Thousands of household tea producers in rural areas continue to rely heavily on the 
tea subsector as their main source of inc ome, making it currently Rwanda's largest employer of both ca sual and 
self-employed workers [1]. The Rwandan tea industry currently consists of 16 functioning plants that are run by 
private corporations and 16 cooperatives that bring together a larger nu mber of smallholder tea farmers who control 
more than 70% of the nation's total tea zones. Over many years, made tea has contributed significantly to the nation's 
agricultural  exports and external revenues.  
As one of the best teams in the world, Rwandan te a is renowned for its exceptional quality. Some of the 
high -quality teas produced in Rwanda include black, orthodox, white, green, organic, and spicy varieties [3]. 
Rwandan Development Board affirms that Rwandan tea has recently reached an all -time high in value at the monthly 
East African Tea Trade Association auction in Mombasa. Nearly 70% of the population of working age is still 
employed in agriculture, which still contributes 24% of Rwanda's national income [4]. Food crops account for almost 
two th irds of agricultural value. Over the past two decades, agricultural growth has been claimed to have averaged 
5.4% annually, with food crop increase accounting for roughly two -thirds of this expansion. Almost 80% of Rwanda's 
farmers are smallholders who wor k exclusively or mostly in subsistence agriculture. MINAGRI (the Rwandan 
Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources) and its departments oversee agricultural activity. Aside from that, the 
NISR (National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda) commissions agr icultural surveys and gathers agricultural statistics. 
Rwanda's 30 districts, which coordinate agricultural activities through district agronomists, cash crop officers, and 
government -appointed workers in the nation's 416 sectors, are the most significant administrative units of local 
government  [5]. The Crop Intensification Program, which ran from 2007 to 2020, has been Rwanda's primary strategy 
for promoting agricultural growth over the previous few years.  
Every human being's physical and economic survi val depends in some manner on agriculture. By 2050, the 
United Nations projects that there will be more than 9 billion people on the planet  [6]. Food output will need to rise by 
70% in order to feed everyone. It is difficult to support the world's farmers and fishermen in achieving this goal, but 
agriculture also plays a vital role in most nations' economies, particularly those in emerging nations. For instance, 
agriculture contributes one third of the GDP and three quarters of employment in Sub -Saharan Africa, but it also 
provides employment for 75 percent of the world's poor.  
In addition to preventing hunger for very poor households, agricultural development can increase incomes 
approximately four times more effectively than growth in any other ind ustry. These factors contribute to the 
explanation of why agricultural development is such an effective strategy for decreasing poverty worldwide and 
stimulating economic growth. Innovation and innovation systems are essential to and necessary for agricult ural 
progress. In both developed and developing countries, innovation is universally acknowledged as a key driver of 
increased productivity, competitiveness, and economic growth. Additionally, innovation is crucial for fostering social 
progress, generat ing money, and reducing poverty  [7] 
NAAR, April  2023 , Volume 6, Issue 4, 105 -118 107 of 118  
 
 Effective bridging mechanisms are frequently needed for communication, translation, and mediation across 
boundaries among the numerous actors in agricultural research and development as well as between knowledge and 
actio n in order for innovation to occur. These innovation coordination tools might range from networks, associations, 
and extension services to ICT as well as other facilitating and bridging systems. By supporting the opening up of the 
research process to inter action and more accessible knowledge use, ICTs support the opportunity to improve 
knowledge flows among knowledge producers, disseminators, and users as well as, for example, among network 
partners. They also support the expansion of stakeholder participat ion in the innovation and governance process 
more effectively and at a lower cost [8] 
ICTs have more frequently been linked to providing cutting -edge services for data management and number 
crunching, geospatial applications, knowledge -based systems, and robotics, as well as better farm machinery and 
processes. However, connecting diverse innovation communities —whether at the local, subsectoral, or national 
level—has received less attention. Agriculture interventions in poor nations are already being posit ively impacted by 
ICTs that act as information "collectors," "analyzers," "sharers," and "disseminators." Access to information on prices, 
good farming practices, soil fertility, pest or disease outbreaks, and extreme weather has increased farmers' 
opportu nities to capitalize on markets, react to unfavorable agricultural conditions more effectively, and better 
interact with public service agents thanks in part to affordable mobile applications  [8], [9] . 
Literature review  
(1) Information and communication techno logy in agricultural innovation  
The creation of new goods or services c an be thought of as innovation [10]. The o rganizational innovation is the 
creation of new knowledge and/or alternative delivery techniques. Practice as a new concept,  comprising all 
organizational activities, new goods, new services, or new procedures  [11]. The ICT is increasingly viewed as a means 
of establishing economic linkages and knowledge exchange with the outside world, as well as boosting the 
transparency and  efficiency of reforms and releasing the constraints of existing stakeholders, according to the current 
conversation  on ICT and Rwandan development [12]. 
Mobile phones are the sole device that the vast majority of low -income country individuals have for connecting to 
the information society. For instance, Tanzania, a neighbouring country, is one of the least developed nations; 
Tanzania ranks 160 out of 191 listed nations on the Human Development Index  [13], with more than 30% of its 40 
million -person po pulation living below the poverty line. The Internet can increase the effectiveness of agricultural 
markets like cell phones, and it is still the only sector that uses ICT. Developing countries are catching up quickly, 
though [14]. 
(2) Market -oriented an d innovative  
Market orientation is thought of as a way to put the marketing notion into practice and has been identified as a key 
factor in new product devel opment and company performance [15]. In a vertically coordinated marketing system, 
market orienta tion as a unified business philosophy in the supply chain demonstrates that participants in each link of 
the value chain are focused on serving the needs of the end customer and strategically coordinate with all other chain 
members to create a superior val ue proposition.  
These studies, on the whole, show a positive association between customer and competitive orientation and the 
impact on innovation. Market orientation, in particular, increases the ability to innovate through a consumer 
understanding, enhan cing production efficiency, sales, and earnings [16].  
According to the study by [17], being customer - and competitor -oriented can improve innovation outcomes. More 
research revealed that customer and competitor orientation boosted the industry's readi ness to produce new goods 
NAAR, April  2023 , Volume 6, Issue 4, 105 -118 108 of 118  
 
 and that there is a strong association between customer and competitor orientation and incremental and radical  
innovation within the industry [11]. 
(4) Information and communication technology in agricultural extension innovatio n 
When information flows freely, the agri -food industry, like many others, has the potential to become stronger and 
more sustainable. Many stakeholders are involved in and rely on the local food supply chain, including primary 
producers, government agencie s, food safety authorities, transportation and distribution, consumers, and others. 
According to research done by [18] Both government and non -governmental organizations have prioritized the 
development of sustainable local food and agricultural business es in the Caribbean; improving knowledge 
mobilization in industry is regarded as a critical aspect in agricultural development and innovation.  
A key starting point in efforts to promote a more informed local agri -food system is by improving the quality of 
agricultural extension and how it is delivered. As a result of promoting the use of information and communication 
technologies (ICTs) in rural agriculture, there is the possibility that extension services can be delivered more 
efficiently and inclusively, thereby contributing to the self -sustaining development of individual agri -food industries. 
Traditionally the agriculture industry in Rwanda used cooperatives as a way to conduct extension and they are seen 
as an important institutional vehicle to improve the performance of the smallholder farm sector [19]. Using social 
media is a great way to reach more consumers, collaborate with colleagues in an effective and timely manner, 
network within and outside the organization, to share agricultural information, learn from the achievements of other 
colleagues, and many other things. Promoters are able to do this by using social medi a tools  [20]. 
ICTs in agricultural financing  
Plans for financial sector growth in Africa to address these issues have generated disa ppointingly few results. 
Financial intermediaries, relatively high -interest rates, wide intermediation spreads, and significant bank profits 
continue to exist. Monetary and macroeconomic unpredictability, strong government demand for loan money, a lack 
of competition, relatively small banks, and contractual concerns, such as limited creditor rights, compromised courts, 
poor bankruptcy frameworks, and general disregard for contracts, are among the reasons. [21]. Many groups have 
pioneered novel ways to agricultural funding since the early 2000s. They sometimes employ the notion of 
microfinance to give agricultural financing, good banking, and mainly agricultural knowledge to enter and flourish in 
this industry. Many of these new strategies show considera ble potential, yet none of them are universally effective. 
Organizations, on the other hand, can be most effective, innovative, and pragmatic when they are not limited by 
dogma, use comprehensive risk management methods and technologies, and retain the abi lity to choose consumers 
rather than allowing governments to do so.  
According to a Chinese study, mobile banking breaks down barriers that have hampered rural lending in China 
and most of the developing world. When compared to traditional physical networks , it allows financial institutions to 
provide services to clients more efficiently and provides advantages for gathering, sending, and sharing information. 
It enables consumers to manage their financial activities despite time, location, and market constra ints. Mobile 
banking has become a significant tool of promoting financial inclusion because it may save time, cut transaction costs, 
and facilitate financing for a wide range of users. It is an especially promising technology for China's rural financial 
market, which is still plagued by financial exclusion. [22] 
Methodology  
This research looks at the impact of ICT on tea producers' inventiveness. To answer the study questions, this work 
used survey questionnaires to conduct interviews. The empirical data for this study was acquired using a 
questionnaire distributed to players (producers, self -commercial farmers, dealers, processors, and exporters) at 
various stages of Rwanda's tea supply chain. These actors were picked for the following reasons: For starte rs, these 
NAAR, April  2023 , Volume 6, Issue 4, 105 -118 109 of 118  
 
 performers have worked in the tea farming industry. That is, they are well -versed in the tea value chain and were 
willing to discuss it throughout the interview. The invitation to many more actors was turned down. It is vital to have 
someone who can provide direct knowledge.  
Measurement Scales  
  A thorough examination of the literature on the impact of ICT on tea farmer innovation. Two English instructors 
assisted in translating the questionnaire into Kinyarwanda and correcting items. As a result,  all of the current study's 
findings were validated in previous researchers' studies. We asked two college association tutors from the School of 
Economics and Management at Southwest Forestry University to double -check the language and presentation of the 
defined items in the current study. The pilot survey included 22 items chosen with the assistance of the 
aforementioned academics.A pilot test was carried out to determine the validity and phrasing of the selected items. 
All items were scored on a 7 -point Likert scale, with "neutral" acting as the mid -point anchor. As indicated by the 
symbol, items assessing the same variable were obtained.as indicated by [23], grouping items is more acceptable for 
responders.

Normality Check  
In this study, the CFA and SEM will be determined using the Maximum Likelihood estimation method. First, we 
tested if the data nearly follow a normal distribution. In general terms, complete standards of kurtosis in dexes greater 
than 10 fundamental values of skew indexes larger than 3 indicate a direct violation of normality [24]. In this paper, 
the skewness indexes scale from −1.824 to 0.234, and the kurtosis indexes range from 1.625 to 5.735. As a result, we can 
show Table 2  that ther e is no violation of normality.

Goodn ess of Fit of Measurement Model  
The measurement model’s properties were assessed by testing the convergent validity, reliability, and discriminant 
validity. The value of composite reliability (C.R.) for all factors see Table 4 below was higher than 0.6, so approving 
the reliability of th e model [25]. Table 4 showed that the factor loadings of all items were larger than 0.5. Also, we 
checked the values of average variance extracted (AVE) for all constructs which were also higher than 0.5, approving 
the convergent validity of the model [26]. We evaluated the square root of AVE for each construct of the model 
(diagonal values)  
in Table 5 which were higher than inner construct correlations (off -diagonal values), showing discriminant validity 
for the model Table 4 showed that the measurement  model lights the condition for the reliability and validity of the 
constructs and discriminant validity. Professional thoughts demonstrated satisfactory validity in terms of instrument 
validity. Cronbach’s Alphas (α) test was used to assess the reliabilit y of the constructed instrument, with a 
significance level of (α ≥ 0.7) as recommended in [27]. The purpose of the factor analysis test was to ensure that the 
degree of relevance of each item in the design was correct. First, the measurement model’s prop erties were evaluated 
by checking the convergent validity, reliability, and discriminant validity. To see if the measurement model matches 
the sample adequately, several goodness -of-fit indices are used. For the data results, the p -value of the Chi -square was 
0.000 (χ 2 = 455.282, df = 182). For a proper model fit, the p -value should be greater than 0.05, as a rule of thumb. In 
contrast, we discovered that the Chi -square is overly sensitive for the samples due to the sample size effect, implying 
that this c hi-square test nearly rejects the model [28]. As a result, using the normed Chi -square (χ 2 /df) (Wheaton et 
al., 2014) is one way to resolve the issue of sample size impact. A normed Chi -square between 1 and 5 was reported 
by[29]. In this analysis, th e samples’ value was χ 2/df = 2.502, indicating an acceptable match. Other indices such as 
the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR), The 
Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Normed -Fit Index (NFI), and Tuck er Lewis Index (TLI) were used to verify whether the 
model fit. The CFI and TLI values should be equal to or higher than 0.90, and the RMSEA should be less than 0.08, 
and the SRMR should be less than 0.08 [30], [31]  All of the measurement model’s applicable fit indexes (χ 2 = 455.282, 
df = 182, p < 0.001; χ 2/df =2.502; CFI = 0.911; TLI = 0.897; RMSEA = 0.078; SRMR =0.01615) were within the expected 
limits, demonstrating that the measurement model fulfilled all of th e model fit requirements. Table 3 , 4 below shows 
the structural equation model results.

Discussion  
This research looked at the impact of ICT on the innovation of tea farmers in Rwanda. The findings of this research 
reveal that ICT has a beneficial effect on agricultural finance and market orientation, which led to greater agricultural 
innovation, which may be explained by findings, which show that ICT can lead to agricultural innovation  [7], [8] . 
The findings also show that ICT improves agricultural financing, market orientation, and agricultural extension. The 
mediator and the independent variable constructs have a pleasant relationship. That suggests that ICT, as a tool, has a 
positive impact not only in our daily lives but also on the farm. It positively influences market orientation, agricultural 
financing, and agricu ltural extension. According to the hypothesis, the independent variables generally influence 
agricultural innovation positively, but the agricultural extension has a smaller impact on innovation.  
The agricultural extension does not directly lead to innovation, which is explained by the fact that Rwandan farmers 
are already grouped in many farming cooperatives, and communication among them is already at a high level. This is 
not surprising because the art of communication and working together among te a farmers in Rwanda is not new, and

 the local government is always involved in updating farmers' skills, introducing new varieties, and workin g hand in 
hand with the farmers  [19]. 
To address modern challenges of innovation, they must be market -oriented a nd consider what the final consumer 
wants and needs. There is also a need to increase financing in agriculture, which is the primary employer in Rwanda, 
and tea is the primary subsector, so more investment is required. Another unexpected finding is that th e relationship 
between ICT and independent variables is more fruitful than the relationship between ICT and dependent variables. 
That is explained by the fact that simply having an Internet connection on a mobile phone is insufficient to innovate if 
there is a lack of understanding of the final end consumer and other involved stakeholders are not equally involved in 
deve loping market -oriented products [32]. 
Conclusion  
The economy of Rwanda and its farmers both benefit from innovation in the tea industry. T ea farming in Rwanda has 
a long history and is very vital to Rwanda's economy. The primary goal of this study is to highlight how crucial it is to 
use ICT to innovate Rwanda's tea -producing sector. This study investigates how ICT applications for market 
orientation, agricultural financing, and agricultural extension can lead to innovation in the tea -producing sector. 
Based on earlier literature searches on related problems, five study hypotheses have been created. A total of 250 
residents of Rwanda's wester n provinces took part in the study and answered 22 questions. Finally, a full explanation 
and the material were gathered and presented. This study has several limitations because the data was gathered from 
the perspectives of farmers, wholesalers, distribu tors, and exporters. As inter -organizational solutions to uncertainty 
may be required, future research may be enhanced by involving consumers. Institutions and stakeholders must pay 
special attention to population growth and the dearth of resources needed to meet the population's expanding needs. 
According to prior talks, central government policies have a significant impact on the growth of the tea business. 
Innovations in the tea sector will also be ensured through the best use of political measures. Find ings from the study 
may have significant additional advantages for regional and national growth, particularly in regard to tea farming, 
ICT advancements, and agricultural advances. Additionally, the results may encourage companies to invest in tea 
farming while working with farmers and other involved stakeholders to achieve a common goal, thereby advancing 
agricultural tea farming innovation. The nature of the data and the sample size employed are two examples of the 
study's limitations. The model does not take into account the factors that are commonly used to predict innovations, 
such as regulatory, economic, and knowledge supply factors. Therefore, an empirical reexamination of Tea's 
innovation determinant should take these elements into account. Investme nts in the tea industry should be improved, 
there is a need to Strengthen the government’s macro -control in improving the tea farming industry in Rwanda
