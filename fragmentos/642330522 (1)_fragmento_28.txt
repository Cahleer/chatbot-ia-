Article 22.1 of the TRIPS Agreement. Feta cheese, Champagne, Pisco, Darjee ling tea, Basmati rice, Parma ham are examples of well-known GIs. The subject of this thesis, however, is not GIs per se ; it is rather the international legal regime for GIs established under the TRIPS Agreement and its legal predecessors. The models presente d fit into the ‘economics of law’ literature. Since intellectual property protection is territoria l, it is interesting to contrast regimes and analyze the impact of specific legal provision s, with no previous judgment as to the soundness of these provisions. The models are kept as tractable, coherent and main- stream as possible and are fully related to well-known bodies of economic theory to ease understanding and referencing. Also, the que stions addressed in the interpretation of results were chosen based on their releva nce in the policy debate and multilateral negotiations. This paper has no empirical work , although case studies and examples are used to illustrate the points made. This introduction gives some figures regard ing GIs and goes into some length into reviewing the international legal framework for the protection of GIs. The remainder of the paper is divided in two Chapters, each Chapter
