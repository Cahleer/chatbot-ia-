Conclusions and Implications 5.1. Research Conclusions This study employs meta-analysis to delve into the relationship between GI prod- ucts and farmer incomes, leveraging a wide array of cross-contextual data samples. With stringent control over publication biases, the research thoroughly investigates the nexus between GI products and farmer incomes from sample, literature, and methodological perspectives, dissecting the potential influences of various factors such as national back- grounds, sample types, literature quality, and research methodologies on this relationship. Through an in-depth integrated examination of the impact mechanism of GI products on Agriculture 2024 ,14, 798 12 of 17 farmer incomes and their boundary effects, the study arrives at interim conclusions from the meta-analysis of GI products, further enriching the research findings in the relevant field. There exists a significant positive correlation between the development of GI products and farmer incomes. Specifically, a highly positive correlation is observed between GI products and per capita disposable income. Concurrently, a moderately positive correla- tion is noted between GI products and agricultural product price increases. This finding suggests that GI products play a pivotal role in enhancing per capita disposable incomes among farmers and, to a certain extent, drive agricultural product price increases, thereby effectively promoting farmer income growth. This conclusion holds significant implications for optimizing agricultural industry structures and elevating farmer income levels. As a unique form of intellectual property protection, GI not only safeguards specific regional products but also brings tangible benefits to farmers [ 52]. On one hand, GI facilitates the deep processing of agricultural products and the expansion of the industrial chain, thereby creating more income channels for farmers. As the industrial chain expands and improves, it promotes the coordinated development of multiple sectors including agricul- ture, industry, and services, generating synergistic effects across industries and creating more employment opportunities. This process enhances rural employment stability and increases farmersâ€™ disposable incomes. On the other hand, the robust premium mechanism of GI is primarily derived from its collective intellectual property attributes, representing the common interests of multiple producers in a given region. Due to their unique regional characteristics and quality commitments, GI products are preferred by consumers, leading to increased market demand and subsequent price increases, thereby yielding premium returns for producers. Moreover, the premium mechanism is closely intertwined with its role in cultural heritage. By preserving and leveraging GI, local traditional cultures can be inherited and promoted, enhancing regional cultural identity and cohesion. This cultural heritage adds unique charm to GI products, increasing their market acceptance and premium space. Strengthening the protection and regulation of GI is crucial for en- hancing farmers economic benefits. To achieve this goal, cooperation among governments, enterprises, and consumers is essential to promote the widespread dissemination and
