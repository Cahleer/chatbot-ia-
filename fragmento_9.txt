To see if the measurement model matches the sample adequately, several goodness -of-fit indices are used. For the data results, the p -value of the Chi -square was 0.000 (χ 2 = 455.282, df = 182). For a proper model fit, the p -value should be greater than 0.05, as a rule of thumb. In contrast, we discovered that the Chi -square is overly sensitive for the samples due to the sample size effect, implying that this c hi-square test nearly rejects the model [28]. As a result, using the normed Chi -square (χ 2 /df) (Wheaton et al., 2014) is one way to resolve the issue of sample size impact. A normed Chi -square between 1 and 5 was reported by[29]. In this analysis, th e samples’ value was χ 2/df = 2.502, indicating an acceptable match. Other indices such as the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR), The Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Normed -Fit Index (NFI), and Tuck er Lewis Index (TLI) were used to verify whether the model fit. The CFI and TLI values should be equal to or higher than 0.90, and the RMSEA should be less than 0.08, and the SRMR should be less than 0.08 [30], [31] All of the measurement model’s applicable fit indexes (χ 2 = 455.282, df = 182, p < 0.001; χ 2/df =2.502; CFI = 0.911; TLI = 0.897; RMSEA = 0.078; SRMR =0.01615) were within the expected limits, demonstrating that the measurement model fulfilled all of th e model fit requirements.
