Literature Encoding This study encoded the literature included in the meta-analysis, including literature information (title, author, and publication date), sample time span, sample size, research area, journal quality, data type, research method, effect size, etc. Variables such as sample country, regional scope, sample type, journal type, journal quality, publication year, research method, and data type will be used as moderating variables in subsequent analyses. The encoding work of this study was independently completed by two researchers. After formulating coding rules, the two researchers independently coded the papers by reading the full text. After coding, the two researchers compared the coding contents and discussed any differences until a final consistent coding was achieved. 4. Meta-Analysis Results 4.1. Publication Bias Test Table 2 shows test of publication bias. During the meta-analysis process, special attention needs to be paid to publication bias [ 49]. The assumption is that studies with small effect sizes are more difficult to publish compared to those with large effect sizes. Therefore, it is necessary to test for this to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results. This study used the fail-safe coefficient method to test for publication bias, and the result showed a fail-safe coefficient of 1218, significantly greater than 505 (5k + 10), indicating no significant publication bias in this study. Additionally, from the perspective of per capita disposable income and agricultural product price increase, the obtained fail-safe coefficient was also greater than the critical value. Therefore, it can be considered that the results generated by the samples in this study are scientific and accurate. Agriculture 2024 ,14, 798 10 of 17 Table 2. Test of publication bias.

Relationship between GI Products and Farmer Incomes In meta-analysis, to select an appropriate model for estimating effect sizes, the het- erogeneity of the samples needs to be considered. When sample heterogeneity is high, a random-effects model is usually adopted, while a fixed-effects model is more suitable when the samples are relatively homogeneous [ 50]. Through heterogeneity tests conducted on the included effect sizes, we found that both overall and subtype GI products exhibited high heterogeneity. Overall, the heterogeneity
