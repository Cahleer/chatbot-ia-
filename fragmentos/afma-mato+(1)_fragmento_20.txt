The EU was not the first and will not be the last to do so. 57 It should be noted however that Japan mostly benefits from other non-IP parts of JEPA, for example from the removal of EU import duties on Japanese cars (Japan’s automobile sector is notoriously strong and that the EU is the biggest importer of road vehicles in the world). It is therefore no surprise that JEPA has been ironically labelled as the “cars-for-cheese” agreement. 58 Australian wine producers also claim that the term ‘Prosecco’ is not a real geographic name, being instead just the name of the grape variety, which therefore should not be monopolised.
