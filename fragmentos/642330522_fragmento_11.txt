monte au nez )”. The appropriation of generic na mes reduces the amount of words available to competitors to describe their prod ucts, shifting the indust ry supply curve up. On the other hand, giving generic status to a GI may increase the sear ch costs of consumers who believe there are quality differences between the old products bearing the GI and the new ones. These costs have to be balanced out against the costs to those that are forbidden the use of the generic term. As Landes & Posner poin t out, “terminating legal protection when a trademark (or a GI) achieves generic status mi ght be criticized as imposing a dichotomous solution to a continuous problem”, since generic status is achieved gradually. But economic efficiency suggests that protection should cease when the costs of continued protection (higher search costs, periphrasis costs, deadweight lo ss) exceed the benefits (minimizing consumer confusion and search costs and maximizing the incentive of firms to maintain consistent product quality). If the Foreign GI is protected, GI-variety sales of Home firms can not use the GI label anymore. If these firms don’t incur into diffe rentiation costs, they will be effectively banned from the market, as by assumption they are not comp etitive enough to compete in the generics segment of the market. If they want to compete, they have to incur a differentiation cost, which can be financed at the industry level (for example through the development of their own GI, hinging on the issue of replication) or at the firm level (through brand development). For simplicity, a fixed cost per GI-variety firm will be assumed, so that the marginal cost of production of GI-varieties increases to . b b>′ 12 GI-variety sales effectively banned In case differentiation costs are exorbitantly high, GI-variety firms are not competitive, only GI-original and generics sales occur. In that case, the indifference condition for GI- original goods is such that the premium over the generic ()a c− must equal the valuation of origin and variety by the marginal cons umer.

To the left of the kink, the slope of the demand curve faced by Foreign firms is steeper than under no protect ion, as it includes the valuation of both variety and origin. Panel C of Figure 2.1 shows that after protection, sales of GI-original and of generics both fill the void left by GI-varieties.
