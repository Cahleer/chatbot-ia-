Examples of AOs covered by the Lisbon Agreement are: Porto, Cognac, Pilsen, Champagne, Bordeaux, Tequ ila, Habano cigar, Jerez, and in general all the French Appellations d’Origine Contrôlée. No n-food products have also been registered, such as the Talavera handcraft (Mexico), the Ch olet cloth (France) and Bohemia glass (Czech Republic) (WIPO 2009). Although the Lisbon Agreement has a rather limited coverage, it grants in many respects a stronger level of protection than that accorded under TRIPS.

However, it is left to members to apply border measures regarding GIs.15 In addition, a series of provisions apply specifically to GIs under Section 3 of Part II of the TRIPS Agreement, aimed at prev enting the use of a GI “in a manner which misleads the public as to the geographical origin of the good” (the “no-misleading requirement”) or “which constitutes an ac t of unfair competition”. The protection extends to the invalidation of the registration of a trademark which cont ains or consists of a GI if (and only if) it is misleading. These provisions apply
