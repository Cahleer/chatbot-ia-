protection for particular geographical indications. It is shown that a strong level of prot ection that would drive national competitors with the Foreign GI out of th e market leads to a loss in gl obal welfare, something which is always expected when fewer varieties are ava ilable in the market. Results, however, are nuanced. Under the assumption of perfect co mpetition, industrialized Home countries, with sophisticated consumers and higher relativ e costs, tend to lose less from protecting Foreign GIs than developing Home countrie s, where the opposite is true. And when oligopolistic competition is a ssumed for Foreign firms, GI-original firms become from differentiated from their closest competitor (now generics), further stressing the competitive distortion; this is a scenario in which industrialized Home countries’ consumers stand lose more than under perfect competition. However, developing Home countries, with a low willingness to pay for orig in but with a high degree of valuation for variety, stand to be the big losers. The case in which sales of national copies of Foreign GIs are not deterred, either due to branding, successful GI replication, or deficient enforcement is also analyzed. Interestingly, it is shown that oligopolisti c competition in Foreign GI developers is actually a scenario that is more favorable to the development of Home copies than the scenario of perfect competition, with ambiguous welfare effects. 23 Bibliography AKERLOF, GEORGE A. 1970.
