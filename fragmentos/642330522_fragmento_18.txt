The first case is drawn in panel B of Figure 2.3 . In the above equations, the first term is th e valuation of origin minus the cost paid on each additional unit of GI-original good consumed at the price premium. The second term is the loss from valuation of variety to those who consumed GI-varieties and must switch to generics, minus the monetary saving on those units (a net loss). The third term is, as under perfect competition, the loss from valuation of variety to those who consumed the GI variety and switch to generics, minus the monetary saving on those units (a net loss). Some conclusions are in sharp contrast with those found under perfect competition: 7 Profits increase unambiguously in case sales increase, bu t not necessarily when they decrease, which is why it is assumed that 01 when they decrease. 20 1. After protection, GI-original goods are mo re differentiated from their closest competitors (generics) than before protection (GI-varieties). This leads Foreign firms to potentially obtain additional rents through a decrease in sales after protection, further stressing the competitive distortion. Industrialized countries, with sophisticated consumers (high G), stand to lose more from this than developing countries. Net welfare is always at a loss when sales of GI-original goods decrease in volume. 2. If sales of GI-original goods increase w ith protection, there might be a potential global welfare gain if the valuation for va riety is low, and the valuation of origin is high. Industrialized countries stand to gain from this. This is because the term might compensate for the losses to those who stick to GI- varieties or to those who switch to generics. () dd
