Welfare analysis Welfare analysis includes consumer and produ cer surplus (profits). Consumer surplus in Home is given by: [] [][] []() [] [] () X c C wheredd a d U dd b a d V dd c b d GA B C dd d U dd d V dd d G CS Z Y XZ Y X + =−∫+ − + ∫+ + − + ∫=− − − ∫+ ∫+ ∫= σσ :0 0 00 0 0 Aggregate operating profits (producer surplus) of Foreign firms are based on a markup over marginal cost, so that Xσ=Π . Profits are zero under perfect competition ( 0=)σ and positive under oligopolistic competition ()0>σ . In case the GI is protected and GI-variety sales are deterred, consumer surplus becomes: [][][] [] [] [] dd a d U dd c a d V d GA C dd d U dd d V d G CS Z XZ X −∫+ + − + + ∫=− − ∫+ + ∫= 0 00 0 ) (σ Aggregate welfare is the sum of Foreig n profits and Home consumers surplus: Π+=CS W Two welfare effects are not taken into consideration: the welfare effect of government spending on enforcement, which implies a monetary disbursement ultimately paid by taxpayers, but which is assumed not to affect the producers and consumers of this market; and the welfare e ffect of the casual consumer mistaking a GI- variety for a GI-original. Derivations are detailed in the Appendix. 3.1 Perfect competition Under perfect competition, sales of generic and GI-original goods both increase after protection and Foreign firms have zero profits. The net welfare effect of protection is given by Home consumer surplus (the argu ments of the integrands are omitted): () ( ) ( ) () ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 0 : 0 10 : 0 1; 1 1 110 1 1 0 0 11 00 11 0 < − − ′− − + ∫− − + ∫= Δ >< − + ∫− − + ∫= Δ =Δ=Δ < < << X Y b b dd b a V dd c b G W Y Ddd b a V dd c b G W Y CCS W Z Y Y X X Y YX XY XX X Whether GI-variety sales are deterred after protection or not, the effect in Home consumer surplus (equal to global welfare in this case) is an unambiguous loss, all terms are negative. In case sales are deterred, the two terms in C1 (drawn in panel C of Figure 18 2.1) correspond to the welfare losses to those who switch to GI-original goods and generics respectively. The first term is the ga in from valuation of origin minus the price premium on those units, a net loss. The second term is the loss from valuation of variety minus the saving on those units, a net loss. In case GI-variety producers are still competitive, the same losses appear in D1 (panel D of Figure 2.1
