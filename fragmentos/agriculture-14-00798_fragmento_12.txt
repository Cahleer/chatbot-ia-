Agriculture 2024 ,14, 798 11 of 17 and conducted subgroup analyses. Detailed research results are shown in Table 4. At the sample level, country differences, regional scope, and sample type all significantly moderate the relationship between GI products and farmer incomes ( p< 0.05). In the context of China, the correlation between GI products and farmer incomes (r = 0.412) is significantly higher than in other countries (r = 0.208), demonstrating a high degree of correlation. This result indicates that GI products in China play a significant role in promoting farmer incomes. Through comparative analysis between national and specific regional situations, we found that the correlation coefficient obtained from specific regional samples is as high as 0.455, significantly higher than that of national samples (r = 0.246). These data suggest that within specific regional scopes, GI products have a more significant impact on farmer incomes. By selecting specific GI products as research samples, we can obtain larger effect sizes (r = 0.400). At the literature level, journal type, journal quality, and publication year significantly moderate the relationship between GI products and farmer incomes ( p< 0.05). Compared to dissertations, articles published in journals are more likely to have a significantly positive impact (r = 0.562), showing a highly positive correlation. Additionally, the results indicate that high-quality journals are more likely to publish articles with positive relationships. Older literature is more likely to publish studies with stronger correlation conclusions (r = 0.635). At the method level, research methods and data types both moderate the relationship between GI products and farmer incomes (p< 0.05). On one hand, using multiple linear regression (r = 0.329) results in a slightly weaker positive correlation compared to other methods (r = 0.360). On the other hand, the strength of the relationship between GI products and farmer incomes under panel data samples (r = 0.332) is significantly higher than under cross-sectional data (r = 0.332). Based on the above analysis, hypothesis H2 is confirmed. Table 4. Moderating effect test.
