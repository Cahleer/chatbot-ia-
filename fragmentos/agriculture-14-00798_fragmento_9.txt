a sufficiently broad range of data documents. Furthermore, to avoid omissions, this study supplemented the search with relevant reviews and meta-analyses for additional references. Through these steps, a total of 7889 initial literature records were obtained. Combining the requirements of the meta-analysis method and the research topic, two independent screeners conducted sequential screening of titles, abstracts, and full texts through multiple steps and included literature in the study. All included literature had to meet the following criteria simultaneously: (1) reporting empiri- cal research with specific experimental steps, excluding purely theoretical and literature review articles; (2) containing at least one relevant relationship between geographical indications and farmer incomes or other indicators that can be transformed into effect sizes; and (3) having mutually independent samples among studies. After the screening, a total of 32 articles met the criteria, including 17 Chinese articles and 15 English articles; 18 journal articles; and 14 dissertations. Since some research documents contain multiple independent effect sizes, this study obtained a total of 140 independent samples. See Figure 3 for the specific literature screening process.
