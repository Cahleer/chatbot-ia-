generic Section 5388(c) of Title 26 of the United States Code establishes special rules regarding the use of GIs deemed semi-generic. In general, these may be used to designate wines of an origin other than that indicated by the GI if the true place of origin of the wine is disclosed, and if the wine conforms to the standard of identity, if any, for such wine. The Section includes the list of semi-generic names: Angelica, Burgundy, Clar et, Chablis, Champagne, Chianti, Malaga, Marsala, Madeira, Moselle, Port, Rhine Wine or Hock, Sauterne, Haut Sauterne, Sherry and Tokay. Under perfect competition, there is marginal cost pricing. In equilibrium, the marginal consumer of a generic must be indifferent between consuming the good and buying it at all; therefore the price of a generic must equal the valuation of consumption by the marginal consumer of a generic. Similarly, the indifference condition for GI-varieties is that the premium over the gen eric must equal the margin al consumer valuation of variety; and the indifference condition for GI-o riginal goods is that the premium over the GI-variety must equal the marginal consumer valuation of origin: This structure is less suited as marginal costs do not pin down th e choices on the alternative goods. 10 Figure 2.1: Equilibria under perfect competition Price = marginal cost abc * 1X *Z DC A * 0X Protection of Foreign GI GI-variety not competitive B = 0 ()c b b>′ Welfare losses * 0Y Price = marginal cost abbc D C BG b+Foreign GI not protected Generics not competitive A = 0 * 0X * 0Y Price = marginal cost abc ′ * 1Y *ZDC B AProtection of Foreign GI GI-variety competitive ()c b b< ′ G b+ ′ * 0X * 1X * 0Y Price = marginal cost abc * 0Y * 0X *Z D C B AForeign GI not protected Area B in Panels B, C, D G b+ G V a+ + U V U+G V U+ + V a+ () [] [] [] [] [] () [] [∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗∗ ∗∗ ∗∗ ∗ + > + > ⇔ < <+ = = − −+ = = − −= = − Y G b c Z V a b Z Y X Z Y X n competitioX G b c X p eqm original GIY V a b Y p eqm iety GIZ U a Z p eqm generics A and : , ,:: var] [ : 1 ] The competition condition is necessary (and sufficient) for generic, GI-variety and GI-original sales to occur.
