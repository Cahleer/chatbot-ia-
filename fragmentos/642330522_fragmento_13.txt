(0): Foreign GI taken as generic The inverse demand curves faced by Home an d Foreign firms are the same than under perfect competition, and th e equilibrium quantities ∗Z and ∗Y, corresponding to total sales and to sales of GI-labeled goods, are the same. This time however, Foreign firms maximize profits by setti ng marginal revenue, and not price, equal to marginal cost, based on Cournot pricing. The segment of the demand curve that is relevant for those purposes is :G b+ () [] [] GNXX G b c X p eqmX G b X P demand originalGI A ′+ + = =+= − ∗ ∗ ∗:] [ ] [ : : 2 where is the negative pa rtial derivative of G with respect to each firm’s quantity. Since the demand curve faced by Foreign firms is kinked at G′ ∗Y, the marginal revenue curve is discontinuous at that point: the segment to the left of ∗Y is placed above the segment to its right, because demand (average revenue) is flatter. The market-clearing price and premium for GI-original goods are determined by the demand function. Panel A of Figure 2.2 shows the demand curves (which haven’t changed, plain lines) and the marginal revenue curve for Fo reign firms (thick dashed). Oligopolistic competition leads to less stringent conditions for GI-varieties to compete, and does not affect generics; only the closest competito r is affected. The distortion is entirely due to Foreign firms havin g some market power, but this is exercised over the origin segment of demand exclusiv ely.

In addition, the interlinkage between the th ree types of goods implies that Foreign firms have room to expand output and threat en the equilibrium for GI-varieties, which is now determined residually from the right by the cost of generics (which pins down demand), and from the left by Foreign firms which can easily exerci se their market power to reduce sales of GI-varieties.
