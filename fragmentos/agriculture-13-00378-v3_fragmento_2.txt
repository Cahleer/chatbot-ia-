products export; urban–rural income gap 1. Introduction Geographical indication (GI) is a special intellectual property right formed by relying on the long-term practices and unique characteristics of a region. It has a natural connection with agriculture, rural areas, and farmers. Preliminary statistics from the Fourth National Geographical Indications Research Report indicate that by 2020, the total number of GI products in China reached 8 421, of which 98.24% are related to agricultural products. GI has a brand effect [ 1], agglomeration effect, and scale effect [ 2], which are of great signiﬁcance in promoting regional development, especially rural development. It is an important intangible asset in promoting the reduction of the income gap between urban and rural areas. Research on GI focuses on the legal policy of GI protection [ 3–5], the behavior of GI stakeholders [ 6–8], and the economic effects of GI [ 9,10]. The good reputation of GI, based on land, plays an important role in improving economic level and enhancing competitiveness. It can organize producers to obtain the scale effect, which helps to resist Agriculture 2023 ,13, 378. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13020378 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture Agriculture 2023 ,13, 378 2 of 16 market risks. The establishment of GI also makes full use of regional characteristics to form regional industries and promote agricultural industrialization, and it has outstanding signiﬁcance in promoting rural economic development and increasing farmers’ income [ 11]. National policies and many studies on rural economy and regional development have always attached great importance to the issue of the urban–rural income gap. Scholars have also explored the causes of the urban–rural income gap and proposed some strategies to solve it [ 12,13]. GI is an important way for farmers to make use of local resources and give full play to local characteristics to obtain higher returns, and it can narrow the urban– rural income gap by increasing farmers’ income. Poetschki et al. used an endogenous switching regression model to explore the impact of GI on farm incomes and found that GI adoption signiﬁcantly improves farm incomes in both the olive and wine sectors [ 14]. Menggala et al. combined questionnaire surveys, interviews, and round table discussions to collect cinnamon harvesters’ information and data. The result shows GI Koerintji cinnamon’s presence has added value and credibility to Tani Sakti Alam Kerinci (TAKTIK) farmers, leading to price improvement [15]. GI is often closely linked to agriculture, so many scholars have placed GI and farmers’ income in the same framework for research [ 11], such as Poetschki [ 14]. Vecchio [ 2] et al. afﬁrmed the role of GI in the development of rural areas and found that it played an important role in increasing farmers’ incomes. However, less attention has been paid to the role of GI in reducing the urban–rural income gap and its underlying mechanisms. GI, which depends on regional resource endowments, is a unique regional intangible asset formed by coupling regional resources, environmental factors, and humanistic factors, and it is the key element in the formation of regional economic
