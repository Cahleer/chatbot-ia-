Extending the protection of geographical indications within and beyond the EU 133being banned from using signs incorporating the term Parma in Canada and being forced to resort until very recently to alternative brands such as “Le Jambon original” or “The original prosciutto” 37. One of the arguments put forward by countries in the New World is that these terms often do not identify anything but just describe the product itself (e.g., the average consumer in the US does not know that “Parmigiano” is the famous cheese produced in the Italian town of Parma); and that therefore the attempt by the EU to claw-back names which have become common in those states constitutes a protectionist measure aimed at monopolising descriptive terms and signs to the detriment of com-petition and consumers (see, for instance, the Chilean claims regarding “Champagne”). This is thus a fight between the New World which embraces a minimalist approach to protecting geographical names 38, and the Old World , especially Europe, which advocates for a strong protection - not only at home, but also in other states via bilateral trade or economic partnership agreements. Indeed, the EU has constantly sought enhancing protection for its geographical names by shifting away from the WTO arena (where the more than two decades long discussion over reforming the TRIPS regime of GIs has been fruitless) 39 toward a variety of bilateral accords that range from standalone agreements on GIs to sectorial accords that provide for mutual recognition and protection of names for wines or spirits 40.
