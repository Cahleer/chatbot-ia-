cohesion. This cultural heritage adds unique charm to GI products, increasing their market acceptance and premium space. Strengthening the protection and regulation of GI is crucial for en- hancing farmers economic benefits. To achieve this goal, cooperation among governments, enterprises, and consumers is essential to promote the widespread dissemination and promotion of GI products, enabling more people to understand and recognize the unique characteristics and values of these goods [53]. Significant national differences exist in the relationship between the development of GI products and farmer incomes. The role of GI in promoting income growth among farmers in China is significantly superior to that in other countries. This can be attributed to two main factors. First, as an agricultural powerhouse, China boasts a vast rural population, with agriculture playing a crucial role in the national economy. Against this macro backdrop, GI plays a pivotal role in increasing farmer income levels. Extensive promotion of GI can effectively stimulate the intrinsic motivation of farmers to participate in the production, processing, and sale of GI agricultural products, diversifying their sources of income and creating more employment opportunities [ 54]. This measure holds profound significance for promoting rural economic development and improving farmers’ living standards. Second, the Chinese government has implemented various measures to promote the protection and development of GI, including constructing a complete legal framework, enhancing supervision and enforcement, and promoting the publicity and popularization of GI brands. In particular, promotional activities for GI brands have significantly increased farmers’ awareness of the importance of GI, sparking their enthusiasm to participate in the production and sale of GI products. By actively engaging in the production and sale of GI products, farmers not only significantly improve the quality and popularity of products but also steadily increase their incomes [55]. The relationship between the development of GI products and farmer incomes is subject to regional scope moderation. The results indicate that, compared to the national scope, the impact of GI products on farmer incomes is more significant in specific regions. This finding reveals the differentiated effects of different GI products on farmer incomes in various regions. GI products typically possess unique regional characteristics and Agriculture 2024 ,14, 798 13 of 17 quality, determined by factors such as local natural environment, climatic conditions, and traditional craftsmanship [ 56]. This uniqueness enhances the market recognition and competitiveness of GI products, thereby providing higher economic returns for farmers. However, considering the rich diversity and widespread distribution of GI products across the country, the relationship effects between these products and farmer incomes also exhibit diversified characteristics. Aggregating various nationwide data may produce a relatively neutral effect value. Therefore, precise delineation of regional scopes helps to more accurately grasp the positive role of GI products in increasing farmer incomes [ 57]. Similarly, sample type significantly moderates the relationship between GI products and farmer incomes. Specific GI products exhibit more pronounced effects on increasing farmer incomes compared to the total GI product quantity. This is because researchers typically select specific GI products
