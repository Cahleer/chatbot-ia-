at the ri ght of the marginal revenue curve under no protection, so that GI-original sales under protection are higher than under no protection. Panels A and B of Figure 2.3 has an example with a marginal revenue curve under protection that is steeper and to the left of the marginal revenue curve under no protection, so that it is in the interest of Fo reign firms to have lower sales after protection in order to increase profits. This is the reverse of the result found under perfect competition, by which sales under protection were higher than under no protection with marginal cost pricing. This distortion is due to oligopolistic competition with a more differentiated product. 16 Figure 2.3: Reduction of sales due to oligopolistic competition by Foreign firms D C A Foreign GI protected GI-variety not competitive B = 0 GI-original low cost ac *Z D C A abc Foreign GI not protected GI-variety not competitive B = 0 GI-original low cost D C Aabcp Foreign GI protected MR curve relatively steep GI-variety not-competitive B = 0 ) (c b b>′ * 0Y * 0X * 1X *Z Price / MR = MC *Z D C A B abbcp * 0X* 0YForeign GI not protecte d MR curve relatively flat * 1X * 0X * 0X *Z There is an intermediary situati on, drawn in panels C and D of Figure 2.3 , which is when some productivity shock or subsidy lowers the marginal cost for GI-varieties to a level that crosses the horizontal segment of the broken marginal revenue curve at c′∗Y in panel C. GI-variety goods are out of the market, but sales and pricing by Foreign firms differ under each regime. If the GI is not protected, sales are capped at ∗Y in volume, a limit-pricing equilibrium due to the discontinu ity of the marginal revenue curve (panel C). If the GI is protected, in equilibrium sales will be lower in volume, at a higher price, to the detriment of consumers, although gen erics supply the decrease in volume of GI- original goods (panel D). GI-variety sales still competitive at b b>' If GI-variety firms are still competitive, the equilibrium is the same as (A2) but with instead of b. The effect this time is ambiguous. Sales of generics will increase as b b>′ ∗Y moves to the left, but the shape of the new demand curve for Foreign (at ) and of its corresponding marginal revenue curve might be such that it is in the interest of G b+′ 17 Foreign firms to lower output in order to increase profits. Panel D of Figure 2.2 shows the case in which Foreign firms expand output. 3 Welfare analysis Welfare analysis includes consumer and produ cer surplus (profits).
