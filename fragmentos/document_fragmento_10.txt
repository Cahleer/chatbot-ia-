2011). Likewise, political entities claim the origin of products as a means of strengthening national sovereignty, rather than merely acknowledging the rights of agricultural producers (Salazar et al., 2007, p. 1525). Hence, Joelson (2004) mentioned that “perhaps no other issue mobilizes nationalist spirit as much as the question of who owns the rights to this centuries-old aguardiente (firewa- ter)” (p. 5). These nationalistic and cultural factors are evi- dent in both countries. For instance, under Chief Resolution 179 of 1988, issued by the Peruvian National Institute of Culture, Pisco was declared a cultural Peruvian national heritage. Similarly, on May 6, 1999, the Peruvian Ministry of Production proclaimed July 4 as the National Day of Pisco in Peru, under Ministerial Resolution 055-99-ITIN- CI/DM of 1999. Later, on May 14, 2009, Chile followed suit when its Ministry of Agriculture de- clared May 15 as their National Day of Pisco. The “truce” proposal, however; shows that Chile’s position may be driven by economic motives, as they believe these should prevail, akin to the Bas- mati rice case. In contrast, Peru’s strong line is driven by the cultural significance of the distil- late as a national symbol. Thus, for the Peruvian government, the nationalistic and cultural factors are strong enough to resist and challenge the inter- national coexistence of both GIs, leading them to interpret the legal provisions for the protection of GIs in this sense. From the above, it can be inferred that Peruvians, unlike the Chilean government, believe that the coexistence of the homonymous GI Pisco would undermine their capacity to project the Peruvian culture on an international stage using Pisco as a national symbol. Additionally, it is worth noting that both products have different regulatory specifications6, attribut- able to the human and natural factors of their ori- gin. This makes them completely different prod- ucts, even if they fall under the same category or type. Moreover, Pisco is recognized as a ‘public property’ good in both countries. The appellations of origin in Peru and Chile are goods owned by the Peruvian7 and Chilean states, respectively. This means that Pisco is both imprescriptible and in- alienable8, and the State must promote and protect it through national policy measures. 6 In Chile, Pisco specifications are set in the Supreme Decree No. 521, Regulation of the Denomination of Origin Pisco of 2000. While, in Peru, the Pisco specifications are set in the Peruvian Technical Standard 211.001:2006 of 2006. 7 Article 88 of the Legislative Decree 1075 of 2008. 8 In Peru, according to Article 73 of the Political Constitution of Peru (1993); and, in Chile according to Article 93 of Law 19039 of 2007. Andrea Jimenez Garay 203Revista de Actualidad Mercantil N° 9 / e-ISSN: 2523-2851 Consequently, Chile often chooses to promote its AO by incorporating the name of the country (i.e., Pisco Chile). Th e same strategy has been adopted in other disputes, such as in the Rioja case between Argentina and Spain. Th is raises a pertinent ques- tion: in such scenarios,
